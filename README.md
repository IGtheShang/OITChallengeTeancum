# OITChallengeTeancum

1.     The runtime/executable version of your program.  √   OITcodeChallengeWindows\cmake-build-debug\OITcodeChallengeWindows

2.     The source code of your program and everything we need to compile and run it. √  OITcodeChallengeWindows\main

3.     All your notes and documentation. If your notes are on paper take a clear picture of them and include them in the GitHub repo. We want to see your thinking as well. This is especially important if you do not finish all the coding. √ （Did not really use a note, coded from scratch in the main)

4.     If your solution requires any external libraries, files, or software, please include them. √ （Edited from Clion, should just run on a Windows PC)

5.     A note about the amount of time you spent on the challenge.    
       (20mins in reading and understanding the challenge, within 1 hour in coding and debugging, 1.5hrs in getting a windows exe.(I use a Mac, It didn't work at the beginning, so I borrowed a windows PC and figured it out, the exe file should run now) 

6.     Whatever other documentation or comments you wish to include.  (Thank you!)
